# Overview

This project adds the capabilities to [OKD](https://www.okd.io/) (formerly [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) Origins) to easily migrate instances from an on-line development environment to an offline (air gapped) 

This project will make use of the upstream OKD [github repo](https://github.com/openshift/origin), but have addition processes and code for cutting a version of OKD from the live development system into production seamlessly.

## OpenShift / OKD

Since the release of OKD 4.0 is imminent, the design will focus on that version and the features included.
